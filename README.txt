Users may play against another person or the computer. I implemented the MiniMax algorithm for when the computer plays, making it only possible for either a draw, or a win for the computer. See the code (with comments included) for insight into how it works. MiniMax makes use of recursion to calculate all the possibilities for every future move, and assign points for every terminal state discovered.
